        <p><strong> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</strong> (15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was an Indian
            aerospace scientist who served as
            the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied
            physics
            and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly
            at the
            Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was
            intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts[1] . He
            thus came
            to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch
            vehicle
            technology<sup> [2][3][4]</sup>. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in
            India's Pokhran-II
            nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>
